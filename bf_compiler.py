#is important to know for incrementing and decrementing


#how do i store the string that is recieved from the genetic swapping
#could store it as a string
# eg "+[><+-}"
#could store it as an array 
# eg string_array["+", "[", ">", "<", ...]
#could store it as an array of function locations
# eg func_array[print_byte, read_byte, ...]
# print func_array:
#[<function sample1 at 0x00000252A04B9400>, <function samplefunc at 0x000002529F9D7F28> ...]


#this needs some thought
#do i want to treat these as loops or quasi goto statements
#each [ could increment a counter which tracks which ] to go to
#similiarly for ]
#eg [ [!] ]
# ! is treated as a ] so the loop will reset back the first [
#also @[ ] asdf]
# @ is treated as a [ so it will skip to asdf if
